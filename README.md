Blockify: Music Dapp on the web
•	Programming Languages: Next.js, Web3.js, Rust. 
•	Blockchain network: Solana Devnet
•	Framework; Anchor
•	RPC provider: QuickNode
•	Wallet: Phantom Wallet

Blockify is a decentralized version of Spotify. 
The user authentication is done using the Phantom wallet.
In order to use the application, the user is required to pay 0.1 Sol.
If the user has already paid the fees, then he/she will be directed to the homepage.
The creator is given an option to upload music files, which then live on the Solana blockchain by paying through their Phantom wallet.
All the important functionalities like liking, Playing, Pausing, Play next and Play previous have been implemented smoothly in the application.


Blockchain guarantees IP rights as an author or creator. The current system makes it easy to steal creators’ content online and fails to protect IP rights. With Blockify, once an artist releases a song on the ledger, it has a unique ID, which protects it from fraud.
